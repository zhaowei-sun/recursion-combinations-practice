/*
Let's say you flipped a coin multiple times, resulting in a given number of heads and tails. Return an array of strings representing all possible histories given those numbers of heads and tails. The strings can be in any order.
Example:
htPermutations(2, 1) ->
 [
   'HHT',
   'HTH'
   'THH'
]
htPermutations(0, 3) ->
 [
'TTT' ]
